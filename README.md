# Game of Life

A React implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Demo

After cloning the repository, install dependencies and run the project:

```
npm install

npm start
```

At this point you should have a local dev version of the app running for development [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Draw on the grid to add/remove living cells.

Use the `Next Step` button to step through the simulation, or hit `Start` to let the simulation run undefinitely.
